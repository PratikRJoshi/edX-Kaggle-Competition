#Test your analytics skills by predicting which iPads listed on eBay will be sold

What makes an eBay listing successful?

Sellers on online auction websites need to understand the characteristics of a successful item listing to maximize their revenue.  Buyers might also be interested in understanding which listings are less attractive so as to score a good deal.  In this competition, we challenge you to develop an analytics model that will help buyers and sellers predict the sales success of a set of eBay listings for Apple iPads from spring 2015.
